## 📚 Problems Included

### 🔢 Problem 1: Number to Text Converter
Convert numbers (0 to 2,147,483,647) into their English text representation using recursion.

**Key Concepts:**
- Recursion
- String manipulation
- Number ranges and patterns

### 📅 Problem 2: Leap Year Checker
Determine if a given year is a leap year using the standard calendar rules.

**Key Concepts:**
- Conditional statements
- Modulus operator
- Calendar logic

### ⚡ Problem 3: Leap Year (Optimized)
Same functionality as Problem 2, but using a single-line solution with logical operators.

**Key Concepts:**
- Logical operators (&&, ||)
- Code optimization
- Operator precedence
- Ternary operator

### ⏰ Problem 4: Year Calculator
Calculate the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds in any given year.

**Key Concepts:**
- Function composition
- Data types (short vs int)
- Arithmetic operations
- Ternary operator

### 📆 Problem 5: Month Calculator
Calculate the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds in any given month of any year.

**Key Concepts:**
- Conditional logic
- Month patterns
- Leap year integration
- Modular programming

### 🚀 Problem 6: Month Calculator (Optimized)
Same functionality as Problem 5, but using an array for direct lookup instead of multiple if-else statements.

**Key Concepts:**
- Arrays and indexing
- Data structures
- Algorithm optimization (O(1) vs O(n))
- Input validation
- Trade-offs (code simplicity vs memory usage)
